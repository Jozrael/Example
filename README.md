# KDM-TTS-Mod
## About This Project
This project is a labor of love (and at times, consternation and frustration) by a dedicated group of fans that want to bring the best virtual KD:M experience to TTS. By its nature, the virtual tabletop is a different experience than physical games, and the virtual version of KD:M primarily exists to broaden the exposure of players to it by lowering various barriers to entry that exist. The physical copy is a beautiful example of the power of art and storytelling to engage players, but the initial cost and difficulty to learn all of the moving parts can be too much for many beginners or hobbyists.

Those who are interested in learning how the game works, can't find a group, or aren't sure about the initial investment cost can use this project to try the game for themselves, and make a more informed decision about purchasing KD:M. Hopefully we all get a chance to play it for real some day, because as much as this team strives to capture the essence of the game, nothing's like the real deal.

While this team is ever mindful of the spirit of the game, some things just don't work in a virtual environment, or they take too long to keep people engaged. So, we have worked to automate many processes, and to streamline those that can't be automated. We feel that it is important for players to really see and feel the tension of the action, to focus on strategies to keep their survivors and settlements alive, and to enjoy even the most tragic of moments (because this game will feed players more tragedy than comfort).

If you have a problem or a bug, please use the "Issues" section to report what you're experiencing. Please search the Open and Closed issues before posting to make sure there isn't already a fix for your problem or someone working on a similar issue other players are having. In your bug report, please let us know how to reproduce the error by recreating it yourself and providing clear instructions for us to reproduce the issue.

Feel free to post suggestions or requests for new features in the issue tracker, but please be specific and concise with the title and content of your issue. Though we can't make any promises about when or if suggestions or feature requests will be included, someone will certainly read each issue that is raised, and it will probably be part of various discussions and planning sessions moving forward. Your suggestion may not manifest exactly as you expected or requested, but you might be surprised to find it nestled in among other optimizations and tweaks that we make along the way.

Finally, we hope that you enjoy the virtual version of this game. We have all volunteered many hours to trying to improve your experiences, whether playing alone or with friends, as you struggle to keep your rag tag group of survivors alive. As was said in the past, we do this for the love of the game, and encourage you to support the official KD:M project by purchasing physical copies and expansion packs when they're available. The virtual tabletop version is here to help you convince your friends that the game is cool enough for you all to pitch in together to buy a copy.

##Contributing to the project:
The methods explained below are an example of one way to create a local repository, import the lua scripts into an IDE/editor, and then to update your repository files so the version control software (Github) can detect the changes.

In order to successfully collaborate on the scripting project for KD:M for Tabletop Simulator, we recommend you review [TC's Guide to Contributing to KD:M-TTS](https://github.com/KDM-TTS/KDM-TTS-Mod/wiki/TC's-Guide-to-Contributing-to-KD:M-TTS).
